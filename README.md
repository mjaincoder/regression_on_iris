Steps followed while performing Regression Analysis:

1. Converting iris.data to iris.csv
2. changing column names
3. Logistic Regression gave 96.67 accuracy
4. Multinomial Logistic Regression gave 100 accuracy
5. Used HeatMap for Confusin Matrix
6. Used a PairGrid for X_test & y_test
7. Also using list comprehension checked manually y_pred & y_test

since 3 categories exist in target variable it was a bit challenging to find the charts to be used.
Now also I don't have a single chart but I am fine using Pairgrid
